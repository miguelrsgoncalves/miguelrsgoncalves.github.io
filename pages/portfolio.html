    <h1>Technical Art</h1>

    As someone who craves to learn as much as possible, I try to be flexible and get deep knowledge of the core principals of graphics programming. Due to that, I have been learning how to make projects in multiple engines, mainly Godot and Unreal Engine 5.

    <h2>Unreal Engine 5</h2>

    <h3>Single Blade Grass System (work in progress)</h3>

    Being fascinated with the grass system in games like Ghost of Tsushima, I started to learn how to make my own single blade grass systems based on Unreal's Niagara Particle System, trying to remake the magic of a sea of grass. This is an improvement over an older project of mine. The system currently supports more than 16 Million grass blades, which I still intend to improve.

    <h3>Grass System</h3>

    A grass system made in Unreal Engine 5 focused on performance and fluidity.

    <h2>Godot</h2>

    <h3>Full Dynamic Painted World (work in progress)</h3>

    A work in progress of a shader system that allows to fully paint all meshes, instantiated or not, in a full game scene. The objective is to have a fully transformative game, where you can paint some parts and leave others unpainted. The system supports a transformation between a 2D stylized look and a fully rendered 3D that blends seamlessly. The system doesn't use any Render Targets, saving up on memory and enabling it to scale indefinitely.

    <h3>Limbo's Gaol</h3>

    Shader work done for a project in Godot. All shaders and particle systems were custom made for this project.

    <h3>Sisyphus Climb</h3>

    Game made in Unity for a University Project inspired by Greek Pottery. In this project I create the sky shader and ground material, player meshes and shader and the boulder shader.
