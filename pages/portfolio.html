    <h1>Technical Art</h1>

    As someone who craves to learn as much as possible, I try to be flexible and get deep knowledge of the core fundamentals of Graphics Programming and Technical Art. Due to that, I have been learning how to make projects in multiple engines, mainly Unreal Engine 5 and Godot, and undertaking a variety of projects.

    <h2>Unreal Engine 5</h2>

    <h3>Single Blade Grass System (work in progress)</h3>

    Being fascinated with the grass system in games like Ghost of Tsushima, I started to learn how to make my own single blade grass systems based on Unreal's Niagara particle system, trying to remake the magic of a sea of grass. This is an improvement over an older project of mine. The system currently supports more than 16 Million grass blades, which I still intend to improve and augment the visuals.

    <h3>Grass System</h3>

    A grass system made in Unreal Engine 5 focused on performance and fluidity. This project uses grass clumps and is able to achieve a high density of grass, filling the landscape with a fluffy carpet.

    <h2>Godot</h2>

    <h3>Full Dynamic Painted World (work in progress)</h3>

    A work in progress of a shader system that allows to fully paint all meshes, instantiated or not, in a full game scene. The objective is to have a fully transformative game, where you can paint some parts and leave others unpainted. The system supports a transformation between a 2D stylized look and a fully rendered 3D that blends seamlessly. The system doesn't use any Render Targets, saving up on memory and enabling it to scale indefinitely.

    <h2>Godot</h2>

    <h3>Limbo's Gaol</h3>

    Shader work done for a project in Godot. All shaders and particle systems were custom made for this project. Limbo's Gaol is a hellish prison hovering above a sea of lava, where souls need to find their way through the interconnected buildings of the jail.

    <h2>Unity</h2>

    <h3>Sisyphus Climb</h3>

    Game made in Unity for a University Project inspired by Greek Pottery. In this project I created the sky shader, ground material, player meshes and shader and the boulder shader.

    <h1>Bonus</h1>

    Although these projects aren't directly related to Technical / VFX Art, they either have qualities that are transformative, like creativity, experimentation and artistic style, or they are a good representation of the quality and effort of my work.

    <h2>Animation</h2>

    <h3>Narrow Escape</h3>

    A 3D animation done entirely in Maya, including modeling and shader work. A good representation of the experimentation with my art style.
