    <h1>Technical Art</h1>

    Driven by a passion for Game Art and Computer Graphics, I strive to craft intricate Technical Art tools and stunning VFX to bring life into video games. From Unreal Engine 5 to Godot, I explore innovative ways to merge art and technology through a variety of technical and artistic projects.

    <h2>Unreal Engine 5</h2>

    <h3>Single Blade Grass System (work in progress)</h3>
    
    <img src="../assets/images/portfolio/single_blade_grass_system.png">

    Being fascinated with the grass system in games like Ghost of Tsushima, I started to learn how to make my own single blade grass systems based on Unreal's Niagara particle system, trying to remake the magic of a sea of grass. This is an improvement over an older project of mine. The system currently supports more than 16 Million grass blades, which I still intend to improve and augment the visuals.

    <h3>Grass System</h3>

    A grass system made using Unreal Engine 5 grass system tools, focused on performance and fluidity. This project uses grass clumps and is able to achieve a high density of grass, filling the landscape with a fluffy carpet. The lighting is done in a stylized cell shader way to create a soothing and calm moonlit night.

    <h3>Full Dynamic Painted World (work in progress)</h3>
    
        <video autoplay controls muted loop controlsList="nodownload" disablePictureInPicture><source src="../assets/videos/portfolio/pigment.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

    A work in progress of a shader system that allows to fully paint all meshes, instantiated or not, in a full game scene. The objective is to have a fully transformative game, where you can paint some parts and leave others unpainted. The system supports a transformation between a 2D stylized look and a fully rendered 3D that blends seamlessly. The system doesn't use any Render Targets, saving up on memory and enabling it to scale indefinitely.

    <h2>Godot</h2>

    <h3>Limbo's Gaol</h3>
    
        <video autoplay controls muted loop controlsList="nodownload" disablePictureInPicture><source src="../assets/videos/portfolio/limbo-gaol.mp4" type="video/mp4"></video>

    Shader work done for a project in Godot. All shaders and particle systems were custom made for this project. Limbo's Gaol is a hellish prison hovering above a sea of lava, where souls need to find their way through the interconnected buildings of the jail.

    <h3>Sisyphus Climb</h3>
    
        <img src="../assets/images/sisyphus_climb_thumbnail.png" alt="Sisyphus Climb Thumbnail.">

    Shaders and modeling made in Unity inspired by Greek Pottery. In this project I created all the visual elements, keeping in mind the necessity of visual harmony and readability while making a heavily stylized visual identity for the game.

    <h1>Bonus</h1>

    Although these projects aren't directly related to Technical / VFX Art, they either require skills that are transferable, like creativity or artistic style, or they are a good representation of the quality and effort of my work.

    <h2>Animation</h2>

    <h3>Narrow Escape</h3>

    A 3D animation done entirely in Maya, including shader work and modeling. A good representation of the experimentation with my art style.
