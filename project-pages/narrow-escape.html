    <h1>The Animation</h1>

            <p>Narrow Escape is a short movie of an action scene that involves Annya, the main character, running away from three goons through a steampunk facility made of weirdly metallic interconnected tubes that lead deeper and deeper into the earth.</p>
            <p>For this project, I wanted to focus on the animation part, creating an animation that showcased fluid, complex
                movements that showed the weight and force behind each action. This lead to the idea of an escape scene.</p>

    <h1>The Concept</h1>
    <p>With the steampunk theme in mind and the focus of the project being on the animation, I begun my brain-storming by imagining how I could create something that looked good but left me as much time for the animation as possible.</p>

    <h2>Modeling</h2>

            <p>One thing I wanted to avoid as much as possible was the uncanny valley effect a lot of low quality animations have. With my project having humanoid characters this could be a very hard challenge. However, being a steampunk setting, the idea came to mind of making my characters people that lived in a hostile environment and needed full body clothing for protection. So I decided all characters would have their entire bodies and faces concealed in oversized clothing and a gas mask. This made it so I did not need to nor model nor animate the faces, and the oversized clothes would hide any imperfection of anatomy the models would have.</p>

            <p>For the environment I wanted it to be an easy to make and to increment playground for the characters to run around. I needed a workflow that would let me easily increase the size of the environment and make as many obstacles as I wanted. This led me to think of an never ending web of metal tubes that would be part of some sort of facility where the tubes would lead deeper and deeper into the ground, ending with an vertical tube that has no visible ending and looks scary to jump into.</p>
