    <h1>PAPERS, PLEASE - The Short Film | Spatial Audio Only Adaptation</h1>

    <p>This project is a re-creation of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFHHGETsxkE" target="_blank">PAPERS, PLEASE - The Short Film by Nikita Ordynskiy</a>, which in on itself is a re-creation of the game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papers,_Please" target="_blank">PAPERS, PLEASE</a> in movie form. This story takes the audience through a day of work of the border Inspector between East Grestin, Arstotzka, and Kolechia, who is tasked with letting in, or sending back, the people that are trying to cross it.</p>
    <p>The aim of this project was to create a spatial audio only experience, where the group decided to make an adaptation of this short film.</p>
    <p>The original work is a fantastic piece of visual media. I highly recommend giving it a watch. The game that inspired this short film is also a fantastic experience.</p>
    <p>My contribution to this work was the section between 1:40 and 8:29.</p>

    <h1>The Adaptation</h1>

    <p>PAPERS, PLEASE is a very visual story. The cinematography, the way the camera zooms and pans through the different paper documents, the pauses between the dialog and the visual cues of uncertainty all play a major role in the storytelling. So, how could this work be translated into a audio only project? We had the challenge of translating all the subble messaging the image was transmitting into audio only.</p>

    <h2>Changes to the Story</h2>

        <div class="text-content">
            <h3>The Officer</h3>
            <p>The first change was the viewport of the audience. Instead of using the Inspector as the eyes of the viewer, we opted to make the Officer a permanenent character, making him the hears of the listener.</p>

    </section>

    <p>This also allowed us to have dialog between the Inspector and the Officer, which would allow us to have exposition of certain details, without having inner dialog. This solved the problem of the visual only parts of the story, like the Inspector looking at the family photo.</p>
    <p>It took away some of the subbtlety of the storytelling, but it was a necessary change to maintain plot cohesion.</p>

    <h2>The Intro</h2>

    <p>While the short film has a intro sequence where the exposition is typed out on screen, we turned that into a narration sequence, where the listener is thrown into the shoes of the Officer who is walking to the border partol, while taking in the backstory of what's to come next.</p>

    <h2>The Sound Cues</h2>

        <div class="text-content">
            <h3>The Stamp</h3>
            <p>In order for the listener to distinguish the accepted and the denied stamp I came up with the idea of using a reverb modifier when the person was denied entrance. Adding dramatic effect and weight to the consequence of the action.</p>

    <section class="text-image-section">
        <div class="text-content">
            <h3>The Chair</h3>
            <p>To convey the undecisiveness of the Inspector during some crucial decesions I made use of chair creaks, giving off the idea of unstillness and conflict within the Inspector's mind. Longer pauses and wait before the decision of pressing the stamp down also helped with the effect.</p>
