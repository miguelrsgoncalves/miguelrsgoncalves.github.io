    <section class="text-image-section">
      <div class="text-content">
          <p>Each Sound Ball has a speed, which is represented by the radius of their trajectory. The bigger the radius the faster the ball.</p>
          <p>Sound Balls make a sound each time the pass through their initial position, represented by a ghostly stationary grey ball.</p>
          <p>The higher a ball is in the Well of Wandering the lower the frequency of it's sound, the lower it is the higher the frequency is.</p>

    <section class="text-image-section reverse">
      <div class="text-content">
          <p>Press record and do a short sound.</p>
          <p>It works better when the sound is made right after pressing record and stopping the recording right after the sound is finished.</p>
          <p>The Speach Ball will then bounce around the Well of Wandering and each time it collides with a Sound Ball it will play the recorded sound with a high reverb modifier.</p>
          <h3>IMPORTANT! Have at least one Sound Ball moving before activating the Speech Ball as having no moving Sound Balls tends to crash it!</h3>
          <h3>The Speech Ball is very temperamental and will crash the Well of Wandering most of the time its used. Its unfortunate :(</h3>
          <h3>If it does not work on your browser, try Google Chrome, as it worked on my tests.</h3>

    <h1 style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Tips and Tricks</h1>

    <h2 style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Fresh Start</h2>
    <p style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Try a full fresh start from the beggining, adjusting each value individualy and try to build a sound you enjoy! This will help you understand what each ball and control does, while also letting you build you own music of choise! It's also the best way to start if you want to be in control of what you are building, not only for a first time.</p>
    <p>For the first time I recommend going with a low amount of balls, either 5 or 10.</p>

    <h2 style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Change Waveforms to Sine / Triangle</h2>
    <p style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Randomizing all values and changing all waveforms to sine or triangle is a great way to get a quick start into a nice and unique base sound. Then you can adjust individualy other values, and choosing some specific balls to have a squared or sawtooth waveform for specific lead notes.</p>

    <h2 style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Psychedelic</h2>
    <p style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Select 25 or 50 balls, turn Spatial Audio on and press randomize. Quikly change all waveforms to either sine or triangle before the square and sawtooth waveforms destroy your hearing capabilities. Close your eyes and let the Well of Wandering take you on a journey.</p>
    
    <h2 style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Chaos</h2>
    <p style="flex: 0 0 100%;">Select 50 balls, turn Spatial Audio on and press randomize. Change all waveforms to either square or sawtooth. Prepare your noise receptors as it will be a direct attack to your hears and soul. I whole heartly don't recommend having the volume too high. I HOLD NO RESPONSABILITY FOR WHAT MIGHT COME!</p>
